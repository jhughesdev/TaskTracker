# Task Tracker

## Purpose

This is a calendar application that users can easily add events, customize, and use to keep track of whatever they would like. 

## Inspiration

[MSU CSE 335](https://www.cse.msu.edu/Courses/cse335/): In CSE 335, I gained a vast amount of knowledge in problem solving, C++, and design.
I wanted to apply everything I learned in this course to my own project to really sharpen my skills and understanding. 


## What I learned

Through this project, I gained the opportunity to enhance my C++ problem solving skills, debugging skills, and gain experience with unit testing. 
I really enjoy user customization, and creating new features that can help users enjoy applications. I also learned more about XML saving and loading,
allowing for one user to have more than one tracker to keep track of events.
